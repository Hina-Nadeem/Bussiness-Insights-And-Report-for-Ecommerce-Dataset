ðŸ“Š E-Commerce Insights Dashboard â€“ Elevvo Internship (Project 3)

ðŸš€ This is my third project completed during the Elevvo Internship, where I worked on E-Commerce Data Analysis & Dashboarding using Python (EDA, Data Cleaning) and Power BI (Data Visualization).

ðŸ”¹ Project Workflow
1. Python â€“ Data Preparation

Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends & patterns.

Cleaned raw data: handled missing values, duplicates, and data inconsistencies.

Merged & joined multiple tables to build a structured dataset for Power BI.

Exported the final cleaned dataset (CSV) for visualization.

2. Power BI â€“ Dashboard Development

Designed a multi-page interactive dashboard to extract insights.

KPIs (Cards):

Total Revenue

Total Orders

Total Customers

Average Review Score

Average Delivery Days

3. Visuals Created:

Sales Trends (Monthly)

Top Product Categories

Payment Methods Distribution

Customer Demographics (State-wise Map & Revenue)

Delivery Performance (Delivery Days Distribution)

Customer Satisfaction (Review Score Breakdown)

Added an Executive Summary Page with key KPIs, charts & business recommendations.

ðŸ“Œ Tools & Technologies

Python â†’ Pandas, NumPy (Data Cleaning, EDA, Merging Tables)

Power BI â†’ Interactive dashboards, KPIs, Data Storytelling

Dataset â†’ Cleaned E-Commerce Dataset

ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights from Dashboard

Top States: SÃ£o Paulo (SP), Rio de Janeiro (RJ), Minas Gerais (MG) drive the most revenue.

Payment Trends: Credit cards are the most preferred payment method.

Delivery: Average delivery time â‰ˆ 11.5 days â†’ needs improvement.

Customer Satisfaction: Most customers leave 4â˜… & 5â˜… reviews, but delivery delays lower scores.

ðŸ’¡ Business Recommendations

Focus marketing in top 3 states (SP, RJ, MG) to maximize ROI.

Improve delivery speed & logistics to reduce delays.

Launch credit card promotions & installment offers to boost sales.

âœ¨ This project enhanced my skills in Python (Data Cleaning & EDA) and Power BI (Data Visualization & Dashboarding), helping me connect raw data to actionable business insights.
